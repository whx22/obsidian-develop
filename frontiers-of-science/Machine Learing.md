## Data

### Acquiring data

1. Manual labeling
2. From observing behaviors
3. Download from websites / partnerships

### Use and mis-use of data

### Data is messy

- Garbage in, garbage out
- Data problems
	- Incorrect labels
	- Missing values
- Multiple types of data
	- unstructured: images, audio, text
	- structured: datasets (data that lives in a giant spreadsheet)
