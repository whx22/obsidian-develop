## Deep learning/(artificial) Neural Network

A powerful way to do machine learning.

A very effective technique for learning A to B or input-output mappings. 

Neural Network and Deep learning  are used almost interchangeably. They mean essentially the same thing.

Neural networks were originally inspired by the brain, but the details of how they work are almost completely unrelated to how biological brains work.

2. reinforcement learning
3. graphical models
4. planning
5. knowledge graph
